            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 lb shell pasta + 1 cup starchy cooking liquid </li>
                <li>1/2 cup olive oil </li>
                <li> 1 small red onion, diced (about 1 cup) 1 shallot, white or yellow onion work, too!</li>
                <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced the best garlic chopper!</li>
                <li>1/2 cup tomato paste</li>
                <li>2 tbsp vodka</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>2 tsp red pepper flakes </li>
                <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup Parmesan cheese + more to taste + sea salt and pepper, to taste + chopped basil, to taste</li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Cook pasta to al dente according to package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid before draining (you may not need all of this, but I always reserve 1 cup).</li>
                <li>While pasta is cooking, over medium heat, add olive oil to a large pan. When oil is hot, add onion. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then add garlic and cook 1 minute more. Stir often so garlic doesn't burn. </li>
                <li> Add tomato paste and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring often. Tomato paste will turn a slightly darker color.</li>
                <li>Add vodka (if using) and cook for 1 minute. To make this dish without vodka simply omit this step OR use one of the substitutions listed in Note 1. </li>
                <li>Add heavy cream and red pepper flakes. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring often until sauce thickens (it will thicken up quickly!). </li>
                <li> Add in your pasta, 1/2 cup of pasta water and butter. Stir, stir, stir until butter is "melted and saucy" according to Gigi! ðŸ™‚ Make sure the pasta is completely coated in the sauce. Add a little more pasta water if sauce seems too thick.</li>
                <li> 
                    Stir in Parmesan cheese. Taste and season with salt and pepper if needed. Sprinkle with basil and serve immediately.</li>
            
            </ul>
