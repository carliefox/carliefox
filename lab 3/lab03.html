    <h2>What is My Hero Academia?</h2>
    <p> My Hero Academia (僕ぼくのヒーローアカデミア Boku no Hīrō Akademia?) is a Manga series serialized by Shonen Jump and written by Kohei Horikoshi. The series has been adapted into an Anime series and an Anime Movie, as well as spawning the Spinoff series My Hero Academia: Vigilantes.
        The story is set in the modern-day, except people with special powers called "Quirks" have become commonplace throughout the world. In a world of chaos and confusion, Pro Heroes have now risen as the new profession to fight off powerful super villains.
        A young boy named Izuku Midoriya is Quirkless, meaning he has no powers, but he still dreams of becoming a great hero one day.</p>
