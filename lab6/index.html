        <h1>How To Help Native Wisconsin Species</h1>

        <p>Turn your yard into a year-round feeding station for Wisconsin birds by
            planting native trees, shrubs and plants. By adding one or more of these
            bird-friendly natives youâ€™ll attract more birds and give them the food and
            shelter they need to raise a family, survive a Wisconsin winter or make the long
            migration south. A win-win for you and the birds</p>
        <p>Oak trees (Quercus species) support over 530 species of butterflies and moth caterpillars, more than any
                other woody plant.Many migrating and nesting birds rely on these caterpillars for food, including such favorites as warblers,
                tanagers, and orioles. Acorns are eaten by blue jays, red-headed woodpeckers and many other native species. The best thing you can do is not cut down the trees!</p>
